    <h2>The Sweet Beggining:</h2>

<div class="content">
<p>It was a calm day.

The sky was blue. Birds were flying. People were happy. Some were working, some were playing, and some were just resting. Everything felt normal.

On that same day, a new chocolate came into the world. It was called "ChocoHeaven". The chocolate had a shiny wrapper — dark red with golden words. It looked rich and beautiful. People didn’t know where it came from, but they loved it.

No ads. No brand. Still, it appeared everywhere.

Shops had it. Offices had it. Schools had it. Even strangers started giving it as a gift.

People tasted it… and they couldn’t stop. It was very tasty.
Soft. Sweet. Melts in the mouth. Everyone said it felt like magic.

In just three days, it became very popular. Almost everyone in the world had eaten it.

But on the fourth day, something went wrong.

It started with one man in Tokyo.

He was walking in a shopping mall. Suddenly, he fell to the floor. He held his neck. He could not breathe.

Then — bubbles started coming out of his mouth.
He choked. He cried.
And then… he died.

People were shocked.

Soon, the same thing happened in other places — Paris, Mumbai, New York, Egypt. More people started falling. All had the same problem: They ate the chocolate.

News channels got scared. Doctors didn’t understand.
“What is this?” they asked.
“A new virus?”
“Some poison?”

The hospitals were full. Families were crying. Everyone was scared.

Far away, in a small town, there lived a man named Sultan.

He was not rich. He didn’t have a big job. But he was very smart. His mind worked like a computer. He had good memory, focus, and fast thinking.

While the world was confused, Sultan stayed calm.
He collected news. He wrote notes. He watched videos. He made a map on his wall with red lines.

And then… he found something strange.
He said to himself,
“This is not a normal sickness. This is made by someone.”

He looked at one picture — a photo of the chocolate.

Sultan narrowed his eyes.
“I’ve never seen this chocolate before,” he whispered.

He had read many science books, studied hundreds of products, and always tried to learn new things. But this chocolate — he had never heard of it. Not in shops, not in brands, not in any old records.

“That’s not normal,” he thought. “If it’s this popular, how come I never saw it before?”

That’s when he knew —
Something was wrong.
Very wrong.

Sultan had found the truth.
He was the first person to know the real cause.

He was not a doctor.
Not a scientist.
But he was the one who understood everything first.

And now… the real story was just beginning.

    <h2>The Sweet Beggining:</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Sultan looked carefully at the photo of the chocolate.
He took a clear picture of it on his phone.

Then, he started his mission.

He went to schools, offices, shops, hospitals, and even malls — anywhere the chocolate had appeared.

He asked everyone one question:
“Where did you get this chocolate?”

Some people said, “It was just on the table.”
Others said, “A man gave it to me outside the shop.”
No one knew the brand. No one knew who made it.

Sultan got more serious.
He asked security guards to check CCTV footage.

And slowly, he found the clue —
A stranger.
Wearing a black coat, a cap, and dark glasses.
The stranger was giving chocolates to random people. He didn’t speak. He didn’t take money. He just smiled and walked away.

Sultan said, “That’s him. I need to find him.”

He waited at the same place the next day.
And yes — the same stranger came back.

Sultan followed him quietly through the crowd.
The stranger kept walking.
He turned into a small street…
And then —
He vanished.
Like smoke. Gone.

Sultan ran everywhere — checked all sides, looked around — but the man had disappeared like magic.

Sultan stood alone in the silent street.
He whispered,
“Who are you… and what are you trying to do?”

That day, Sultan knew —
This was not a normal chocolate.
This was not a normal man.

A dangerous game had started.
And Sultan had just taken his first step into it.

   <h4>😇.............To Be Continued..........😈</h4>

    <h2>The Truth Behind The Sweet:</h2>
    <div class="content">

    <p>






Sultan didn’t sleep that night.
He sat at his desk, thinking deeply.
His mind was full of questions.

“Who is that stranger?”
“Where did the chocolate come from?”
“Why are people dying after eating it?”

He opened his laptop and started searching.
He checked news websites, forums, science blogs, and health reports.
Some countries had already banned the chocolate, but no one knew who made it.

Then, Sultan made a map on his wall.

He marked every city where the chocolate was found.
He connected the places with red lines.
And slowly, a pattern started to appear.

The chocolate was not spread randomly.
It was moving from one country to another — like a plan.

Sultan’s eyes became sharp.

He said,
“This is not a mistake. This is someone’s mission.”


---

The next day, he went to a hospital where a patient had eaten the chocolate.

He talked to a doctor.

The doctor said,

> “At first, we didn’t understand. But now we know…
The chocolate has a chemical. It works slowly.
After 3 or 4 days, it causes a block in the throat.
The patient can’t breathe… and white bubbles come from their mouth.
Then, they die.”



Sultan asked,
“Can we save them?”

The doctor replied sadly,

> “Right now, no. We don’t have a cure. We don’t even know the full formula yet.”



Sultan clenched his fist.
He knew he had to do something fast.


---

He went home and started researching chemicals.
Then suddenly —
He remembered something from one of his old books.

A strange, secret chemical.
It was called “Birhudu” — found only in deep caves in a hidden place.

Sultan’s eyes widened.
“If I find Birhudu, I can save people.”

But where was it?

He needed more clues.
He needed to find that stranger again.


---

The next day, Sultan heard a whisper on the street.
A man said,

> “A strange person gave my son that chocolate yesterday… near the railway station.”



Sultan rushed there.
He waited for hours.

And then…
He saw the stranger again.

But this time —
Sultan was ready.
He quietly followed him…
And after a long walk — the stranger went inside a hidden cave behind some rocks.

Sultan stayed silent.
He waited until the stranger went deeper inside.
Then, he followed him — slowly and carefully…

And what he saw inside the cave…
Would change the world forever.


---

Let me know, Ushasri, when you're ready for Chapter 3 — where Sultan finally discovers the villain Sukemavansu and hears his painful backstory.</p>

  <h2>The Man Behind The Chocolate:</h2>
  <div class="content">
<p>



Sultan stepped quietly into the dark cave.
The air inside was cold and still.
He could hear only the sound of his breath.

He walked deeper and deeper...
And then, he saw a bright light coming from one corner.

He hid behind a rock and peeked.
There was a large room — filled with machines, screens, and strange chemicals.
In the center, a man stood — tall, silent, and wearing a long black coat.

The man was working on something.
He was building a robot.

Sultan whispered,
"So… this is the one behind all this."

Suddenly — the man turned.
His eyes were sharp like knives.
He already knew someone was there.

He slowly said,
"I’ve been waiting for someone like you."

Sultan came out from the shadow.
He asked,
“Why are you doing this? Why are you killing innocent people?”

The man looked at him… and smiled sadly.

He said,
“My name… is Sukemavansu.”


---

The Villain’s Story Begins

Sukemavansu sat down on a cold chair and said,
“Let me tell you something before you try to stop me.
You should know the truth about this world.”

Sultan stayed quiet and listened.

Sukemavansu began…

> “I was once a scientist too.
I had big dreams. I wanted to help students.
I created amazing machines. I built new technologies.
But no one… NO ONE ever encouraged me.”

“Universities rejected me.”
“Companies laughed at me.”
“Cities banned my projects.”
“I showed my inventions to the world — but the world turned its back on me.”

“So I decided…
If they don’t want my help,
then they don’t deserve to live.”



Sultan's heart felt heavy. But he didn’t show it.

He asked,
“So… you want revenge?”

Sukemavansu replied,
“Not just revenge. I want to be the god of this world.
I made robots that look like helpers. But they are not.
They are killers.
Half of the humans are already dead.”

Sultan’s eyes widened in shock.

"You did this…?"

“Yes.” Sukemavansu smiled.
“And soon, I will control the rest of the world too. With my robots, and with my chocolate.”

Sultan slowly reached into his bag.
He took out a small device — recording everything.

He said firmly,
“I won’t let you destroy the rest of the world.”

Sukemavansu laughed.
“Then fight me. Use your knowledge. Let’s see if that’s enough.”


---

The battle was not just with weapons.
It was with brains vs power,
heart vs hate,
hope vs revenge.

And this was just the beginning.


</p>






  </div>
</div>
<div class="page" id="page7">
  <h1>Chapter-4</h1>
  <h2>The Race Against Time:</h2>
  <div class="content">
<p>

Sultan ran out of the cave.

His heart was heavy with fear,
but his mind was full of plans.

He now knew the truth —
Sukemavansu was not just a killer.
He was a genius gone wrong.
And the world was dying because of his plan.

The chocolate was still killing people.
Sultan had only 3 to 4 days to stop everything.


---

The Countdown Begins

He sat down in his small room.
He pulled out a notebook and drew a mind map.
His brain was moving fast like a storm.

> “Where is the control button?”
“Where is the bottle of Birhudu?”
“How can I stop the robots?”
“How can I save the people who ate the chocolate?”



He remembered that the cave had both:

A red button that could shut down all AIs

A bottle of Birhudu that could heal 25–30% of poisoned people



---

What is Birhudu?

It was a rare, powerful liquid made from ancient forest herbs.
Just a few drops could clean the poison from the human body.
It gave a second chance to those who ate the deadly chocolate.

But it was hidden inside the cave…
And that cave was now guarded by killer robots.


---

Sukemavansu’s Terrifying Transformation

Long ago, Sukemavansu was a human just like anyone else.
But he tested strange chemicals and formulas on himself.

One day, he took his own final medicine —
the one he made secretly.

And everything changed.

His body became stronger, tougher, faster.
His mind became sharper, more dangerous.
He no longer thought like a man —
he started thinking like a machine with power.

That’s when he decided…

> “I will become the God of this world.
And robots will be my children.”




---

Sultan’s Plan

Back in his room, Sultan began preparing.
He built a small robot to distract the guards.
He gathered tools, wires, a hacking chip, and a tiny EMP.

He took deep breaths.

> “I must go inside that cave.
I must press that button.
I must get the Birhudu.
I must save the world.”




---

The Final Mission Begins

At night, Sultan wore his protective gear.
He took his small robot and moved through the dark.

The cave was glowing red.
Tall robots stood like statues, scanning the area.

Sultan whispered,
“Let’s begin.”

He sent his robot.
It beeped and jumped.
The guard robots followed it like fools.

Now, Sultan ran inside.

He saw the red button blinking.

But just before he pressed it—

BEEP.
A huge screen turned on.

Sukemavansu appeared and smiled.

“You didn’t think it would be that easy, did you?”

And suddenly, the floor began to shake.

From the ground…
a giant machine rose.

It was the final protector.
A monster made of steel.

“THE DESTROYER” was awake.

And Sultan’s biggest battle was just about to begin.
</p>

  </div>

</div>
<div class="page" id="page8">
<h1> Chapter-5</h1>
<h2>The Final Stand:</h2>
<div class="content">
  <p>


Sultan stood face to face with The Destroyer —
a huge, deadly robot made by Sukemavansu.

It was 10 feet tall, made of strong metal.
Its eyes glowed red, and its arms had spinning blades.

Sultan’s heart was beating fast.
He had no weapons… only his mind.

But he wasn’t scared.

> “I didn’t come this far to fail.”




---

The Smart Fight Begins

The Destroyer moved to attack.

Sultan jumped, rolled, and ran.
He knew he couldn’t win with power.

So he used his mind-map memory.

He remembered the robot’s weak points
from Sukemavansu’s old blueprint.

He quickly ran toward a control panel
and hacked the system using his chip.

BZZZK!
The robot shook, sparks flew out.

But it wasn’t over.
The robot was now angry.


---

The Red Button and the Twist

Sultan ran toward the red button to stop the AIs.

He was just inches away...

Suddenly —
BANG!

Sukemavansu himself appeared from the shadows.

He was not alone.
His body looked different.
It was glowing — half human, half machine.

> “I told you, Sultan… you can’t stop me.”



He pulled out a weapon.
A long electric whip.

And for the first time —
Sultan and Sukemavansu began a real fight.


---

Mind vs Power

Sultan fought with both brain and body.
He used his time focus skill —
he could predict Sukemavansu’s moves before they happened.

But Sukemavansu had super strength.

He threw Sultan to the wall.

> “You’re too late. The world is mine!”



Sultan stood back up, bleeding but brave.

> “You became this… because you were hurt.
But pain is no excuse to destroy millions.”




---

The Final Move

Sultan suddenly pulled out something:

A small glass bottle —
Birhudu.

He threw it into the air and crushed it.

The smell spread fast —
it flew through the vents and reached the world.

People who were dying from chocolate
suddenly started breathing again.

Birhudu was saving them!

Sultan turned and pressed the red button.

BOOOOM!

All the killer robots across the world…
stopped moving.

Eyes turned black.

Dead silence.


---

The End… or a Beginning?

Sukemavansu screamed.

> “NO! THIS IS NOT THE END!”



He jumped into a secret trap door below the cave…
and vanished.

Sultan stood alone.

He looked up at the sky.

Half the world was saved.
Half the world was lost.

But the evil plan was stopped.

For now.

  <h2>Note:Moral Of The Story</h2>
  <div class="content-final" id="page10">
    <p>This story is not just about science, revenge, or power.
It is about how we treat people around us.

Many people in this world have big dreams. But sometimes, instead of supporting them, the world discourages them. That pain can turn into anger. That anger can become destruction.

But remember this:

 No matter how much the world pulls you down, never lose your goodness.
 If you have power, use it to build the world, not break it.
 Even when no one supports you, be strong. Be kind. Be better.

The real hero is not the one with the biggest powers.
The real hero is the one who chooses to do the right thing, even when the world is wrong.
