    <h2>The Sweet Beggining:</h2>

<div class="content">
<p>It was a calm day.

The sky was blue. Birds were flying. People were happy. Some were working, some were playing, and some were just resting. Everything felt normal.

On that same day, a new chocolate came into the world. It was called "ChocoHeaven". The chocolate had a shiny wrapper — dark red with golden words. It looked rich and beautiful. People didn’t know where it came from, but they loved it.

No ads. No brand. Still, it appeared everywhere.

Shops had it. Offices had it. Schools had it. Even strangers started giving it as a gift.

People tasted it… and they couldn’t stop. It was very tasty.
Soft. Sweet. Melts in the mouth. Everyone said it felt like magic.

In just three days, it became very popular. Almost everyone in the world had eaten it.

But on the fourth day, something went wrong.

It started with one man in Tokyo.

He was walking in a shopping mall. Suddenly, he fell to the floor. He held his neck. He could not breathe.

Then — bubbles started coming out of his mouth.
He choked. He cried.
And then… he died.

People were shocked.

Soon, the same thing happened in other places — Paris, Mumbai, New York, Egypt. More people started falling. All had the same problem: They ate the chocolate.

News channels got scared. Doctors didn’t understand.
“What is this?” they asked.
“A new virus?”
“Some poison?”

The hospitals were full. Families were crying. Everyone was scared.

Far away, in a small town, there lived a man named Sultan.

He was not rich. He didn’t have a big job. But he was very smart. His mind worked like a computer. He had good memory, focus, and fast thinking.

While the world was confused, Sultan stayed calm.
He collected news. He wrote notes. He watched videos. He made a map on his wall with red lines.

And then… he found something strange.
He said to himself,
“This is not a normal sickness. This is made by someone.”

He looked at one picture — a photo of the chocolate.

Sultan narrowed his eyes.
“I’ve never seen this chocolate before,” he whispered.

He had read many science books, studied hundreds of products, and always tried to learn new things. But this chocolate — he had never heard of it. Not in shops, not in brands, not in any old records.

“That’s not normal,” he thought. “If it’s this popular, how come I never saw it before?”

That’s when he knew —
Something was wrong.
Very wrong.

Sultan had found the truth.
He was the first person to know the real cause.

He was not a doctor.
Not a scientist.
But he was the one who understood everything first.

And now… the real story was just beginning.

    <h2>The Sweet Beggining:</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Sultan looked carefully at the photo of the chocolate.
He took a clear picture of it on his phone.

Then, he started his mission.

He went to schools, offices, shops, hospitals, and even malls — anywhere the chocolate had appeared.

He asked everyone one question:
“Where did you get this chocolate?”

Some people said, “It was just on the table.”
Others said, “A man gave it to me outside the shop.”
No one knew the brand. No one knew who made it.

Sultan got more serious.
He asked security guards to check CCTV footage.

And slowly, he found the clue —
A stranger.
Wearing a black coat, a cap, and dark glasses.
The stranger was giving chocolates to random people. He didn’t speak. He didn’t take money. He just smiled and walked away.

Sultan said, “That’s him. I need to find him.”

He waited at the same place the next day.
And yes — the same stranger came back.

Sultan followed him quietly through the crowd.
The stranger kept walking.
He turned into a small street…
And then —
He vanished.
Like smoke. Gone.

Sultan ran everywhere — checked all sides, looked around — but the man had disappeared like magic.

Sultan stood alone in the silent street.
He whispered,
“Who are you… and what are you trying to do?”

That day, Sultan knew —
This was not a normal chocolate.
This was not a normal man.

A dangerous game had started.
And Sultan had just taken his first step into it.
